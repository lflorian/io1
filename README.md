## Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge II
### Grupo 10 - Luis Florian, Paolo Solombrino y Daniel Marroquín

#### Data Set Information:
The dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:

binary features low- and high-cardinality nominal features low- and high-cardinality ordinal features (potentially) cyclical features This follow-up competition offers an even more challenging dataset so that you can continue to build your skills with the common machine learning task of encoding categorical variables. This challenge adds the additional complexity of feature interactions, as well as missing data.

This Playground competition will give you the opportunity to try different encoding schemes for different algorithms to compare how they perform. We encourage you to share what you find with the community.

If you're not sure how to get started, you can check out the Categorical Variables section of Kaggle's Intermediate Machine Learning course.
